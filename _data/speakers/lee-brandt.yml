bio: "After almost two decades writing software professionally (and a few years unprofessionally before that), Lee Brandt still continues to learn every day. He has led teams in small and large companies and always manages to keep the business needs at the forefront of software development efforts. He speaks internationally about software development, from both a technical and business perspective, and loves to teach others what he learns. Lee writes software in Objective-C, JavaScript and C#... mostly. He is a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Visual C#, one of the directors of the Kansas City Developer Conference (KCDC), and serves as the Regional Mentor for .Net user groups in Kansas and Missouri. Lee is a decorated Gulf War veteran, a husband, a proud pet parent and loves to play the drums whenever he gets any spare time."
