bio: "Kirschen's background is Computer Sciences with interests in Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, and Mac OS X / iPhone OS  development. She started programming with BASIC in 1978 on an Apple ][, and has over 30 years of experience in the field. She worked on OPENSTEP (precursor to Mac OS X Cocoa) graphical prototyping applications on joining Rockwell Collins in 1999. Her role as a Principal Systems Engineer in the Advanced Concepts Group lets her interact with fellow engineers in the company, direct projects, as well as run a lab environment for advanced prototyping for aircraft flight decks. Prior to joining Rockwell Collins, she worked at Acuity (formerly iChat) developing interactive user interfaces for live chat customer service agents. She has been awarded several US patents, and has been recognised within the company and outside for contributions to engineering. In her remaining spare time (infinite of course!) she works on her blog, develops Mac OS X, and iPhone OS applications. She's really motivated to share her experience to help fellow software practitioners develop better skills - be that in good design, implementation, or computer science fundamentals.
