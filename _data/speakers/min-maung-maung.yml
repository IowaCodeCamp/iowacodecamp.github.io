bio: "Name a new technology that Min isn't interested in. Min has developed on all mobile platforms from latest Windows 8 to Windows Mobile 6.5. Of course that also means that he has had countless smartphones and tablets. Min is often honing his skills by aggressively competing in hackathons dating back to his days at Dominican University. Being technologically agnostic, he does not stop tinkering with mobile platforms like Android, he creates his own personal microcontrollers for robotics projects. When he's not coding, he's building robots. When he's not adding more robots to his robot army, you will see him speaking at conferences such as That Conference and CodeMash. Monday through Friday, you'll find him cranking out .Net code and writing apps in ASP.Net, KendoUI, Knockout.js, Node.js, and other web solutions."
