bio: "Jon is a C# MVP and Consultant from West Des Moines, Iowa. He became interested in code in his junior high programming class when, in a \"delusion of grandeur\", Jon convinced himself he found a pattern to prime numbers using BASIC-A. Although deflated after realizing his theory was quite silly, his passion for writing software flourished and Jon continued on to get a degree in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University. He has been paid to develop everything from Excel Macros to large scale genetic visualizations using WPF. Currently, Jon is the tech lead for two new developer tools - Nitriq Code Analysis and Atomiq Duplicate Code Finder."
