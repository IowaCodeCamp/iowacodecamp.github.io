title: "Good agile, Bad Agile"
description: "There's been a lot of talk recently about Agile software development. As people try to make the transition, they generally find themselves stumbling and maybe even giving up on Agile altogether. In this session we will discuss what Agile is, and what it isn't. Most importantly how to chose the \"flavor\" that is right for your organization, and how to get started."
