title: "Introduction to UX Personae"
description: "Who uses this thing? It's a question sometimes asked by every developer at some point in their career.  Requirements and requests come in but there's no information as to why it's important or how such can even be justified. In this session, James will walk you through the User Experience (UX) practice of Persona creation.  He'll explain what they are, why they are important, and how to go about creating such.  If you ever wanted to know how to find out who the users are of your product or wanted to learn more about one of the primary exercises of product design, this session is for you."
