title: "Mobile First - From Theory to Execution"
description: "With mobile browsing projected to exceed desktop browsing by the end of 2015, mobile development can no longer be an afterthought. We'll begin with a brief introduction to the landscape of mobile development. Where we've been and where we are heading. We need to then figure out how do we shift to \"mobile first\". What does it mean? How do we shift our thinking?Learn how to make the transition from designing for desktops/laptops to designing for mobile. In this session we'll explore a hands on demonstration of developing a mobile-first website utilizing Bootstrap. See how their latest release has made the shift to the mobile first mind set. We'll also have a brief overview in how to transition from 2.x to 3.1."
