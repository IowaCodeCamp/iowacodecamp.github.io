title: "Are You a SOLID Coder?"
description: "This course provides a detailed introduction to the Object Oriented techniques identified by Robert Martin as the SOLID principles of software design. Intended for both novice and intermediary developers, each of the five principles are fully defined and explored.  Real-world coding examples are provided for each software tenant to help fully expound upon the design techniques. By the end of the session, developers will be able to identify common code smells while applying SOLID programming practices that ensure clean and maintainable code."
