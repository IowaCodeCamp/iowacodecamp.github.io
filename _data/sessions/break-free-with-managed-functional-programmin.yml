title: "Break Free with Managed Functional Programming: An Introduction to F#"
description: "Originally developed by Microsoft Research, Cambridge, F# is an open-source, functional-first language in the ML family. Despite its lofty position as a first-class Visual Studio language for the past two releases and its cross-platform availability it hasn't seen widespread adoption in the enterprise. In this session we'll take an introductory look at F#, exploring how its constructs and terse syntax allow you to write more stable, maintainable code while keeping you focused on the problem rather than the plumbing."
