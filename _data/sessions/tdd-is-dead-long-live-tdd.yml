title: "TDD is Dead, Long live TDD"
description: "Recently there has been talk about Test Driven Development (TDD) being dead. A lot of big names in the software community have been involved in discussions on this topic. I agree with some of the arguments on both sides of the discussion. My personal style of TDD has changed significantly over the past few years because of some of the arguments against TDD. I will discuss how my style of TDD has changed and why it has changed. I will also demonstrate my original TDD style as well as my current TDD style so you can see first hand how my approach has changed."
