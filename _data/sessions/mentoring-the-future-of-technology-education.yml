title: "Mentoring - The Future of Technology Education"
description: "Computer science jobs are growing at a faster rate than any other career path in the United States, yet 9 out of 10 schools don't offer programming classes. Schools that do offer classes struggle to fill those positions with teachers with a background in programming. While there is a push for getting more technology into schools, there will always be struggle with keeping curriculum in sync with current industry needs. In this session we'll explore the gaps in computer science education, look at why mentoring and after-school programs are an excellent solution for this problem, and talk about ways to implement programs in your area."
