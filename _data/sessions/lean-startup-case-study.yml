title: $0 to $60,000 A Month In 6 Months - A Lean Startup Case Study on Agile Software Architecture
description: Agile Development and Lean Startup are about creating cultures centered around the pursuit of knowledge, embracing "I Don't Know" as a perfectly acceptable answer, and an unacceptable solution. The companies that learn the fastest, win. From November 2013 through April 2014 MensStyleLab.com's revenue grew over 80% month over month, reaching over $60K in sales in a single month in April 2014. In this session I'll break down the steps that we took and what we learned along the way. We'll investigate the tools that startups use to measure and drive growth on a shoestring budget, and how these same principles can be applied anywhere to grow lean, with very little wasted time, effort, or resources.
