title: "X-platform with Xamarin: Have your C# and mobile too"
description: "Let's talk about how you can take your .Net/C# skills and use them to start building mobile applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. Using Xamarin it's still possible to use Visual Studio, Linq, lambdas, and all the other goodies that make a lot of people appreciate the productivity possible with .Net/C#. We'll also talk about ways to organize cross platform mobile solutions, some helpful cross-platform frameworks and libraries, and what some of the drawbacks and \"gotchas\" are."
