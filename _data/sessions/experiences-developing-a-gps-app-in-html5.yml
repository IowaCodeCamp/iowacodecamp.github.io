title: "Experiences developing a GPS app in HTML5"
description: "Fairfield, IA has a 17 mile loop trail that has been developed over the last 10 years. I volunteered to write an app that would show distances and terrain on the trail plus provide GPS when on the trail. The talk will cover how the interface developed and a comparison of the HTML5 version with native app versions."
