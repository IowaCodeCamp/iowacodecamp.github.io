You know the basics of the language and you can get things done, and applications shipped. But as the proliferation of JavaScript continues into frameworks like UnderscoreJS, KnockoutJS, AngularJS, AnyOtherThingYouCanThinkOfJS, and even to the server (with NodeJS) you may find yourself struggling to understand how to write professional, full-fledged applications using JavaScript. In this session you will LevelUp your JavaScript skills by learning about closures and how they help to modularize your javascript. Prototypal inheritance and how you can extend JavaScript and you will learn about JavaScript design patterns and how they can take your JavaScript skills to the next level!"
