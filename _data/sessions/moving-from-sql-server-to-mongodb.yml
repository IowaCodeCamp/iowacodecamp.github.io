title: "Moving from SQL Server to MongoDB"
description: "When we began hacking away on Hudl we chose SQL Server as our database. After a few years and solid company growth we realized SQL Server was becoming a bottleneck. Because we run in the cloud, vertically scaling our DB was not a great option. That's when we began to look at NoSQL seriously and specifically MongoDB. We wanted something that was fast, flexible and developer-friendly. In this talk we'll take a look at our schema design choices, our migration process and the performance we've seen with MongoDB."
