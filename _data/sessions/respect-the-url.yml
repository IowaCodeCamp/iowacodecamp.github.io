title: "Respect the URL"
description: "As web developers we seem to have forgotten how powerful the web is. The url used to give us a unique resource, until we started abusing it by using JavaScript to change the content of the page without changing the url. We will take a quick look at what has happened to the url and how these new JavaScript frameworks are helping us to fix what we as web developers have broken."
