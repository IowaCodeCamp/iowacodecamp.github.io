We won't be creating an Aspire project that pre-wires everything up for you. We'll start with an empty project and then add on the Aspire bits so you can see how this works under the hood. We'll set up the app host, the service defaults, various Aspire components, and of course the fancy dashboard.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll not only have a better understanding of what Aspire is and how it works, but you'll also realize that every application should be using Aspire today, not just cloud native distributed applications.",

With 89% of enterprises now utilizing multi-cloud strategies, this approach offers a strategic advantage in reducing vendor lock-in, accessing diverse services, and achieving significant financial savings.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore the nuances of multi-cloud implementation, focusing on how to strategically optimize workloads, leverage a diverse array of cloud services, and select the right instance types to maximize cost savings. By presenting data from leading industry reports, we will illustrate how organizations employing multi-cloud strategies have achieved an average of 15% reduction in cloud expenditures and a 93% decrease in unplanned downtime.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn how to effectively distribute workloads based on performance and cost criteria, utilize various cloud providers to cut costs by up to 90% through spot instances, and enhance system resilience through geographic diversity and redundancy. Additionally, the presentation will emphasize the importance of ongoing benchmarking to ensure real-time cost and performance optimization, offering insights into improving negotiation leverage and refining cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe will also address common challenges in multi-cloud management, including complexity, data transfer costs, and governance issues, and provide practical solutions such as advanced management tools and standardized processes. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies to develop cost-effective, resilient, and scalable multi-cloud architectures, paving the way for sustained operational success.\r\n\r\n",
