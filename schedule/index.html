Did you know that's not the case? .NET Aspire brings value to any application whether it's a single majestic monolith running on-premises or an application with thousands of microservices running in the cloud.

In this talk, we'll break down Aspire from the ground up. We won't be creating an Aspire project that pre-wires everything up for you. We'll start with an empty project and then add on the Aspire bits so you can see how this works under the hood. We'll set up the app host, the service defaults, various Aspire components, and of course the fancy dashboard.

By the end of this talk, you'll not only have a better understanding of what Aspire is and how it works, but you'll also realize that every application should be using Aspire today, not just cloud native distributed applications. </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

You know that once you check in a secret it should be considered compromised so you've built a robust rotation strategy and you are ready to move forward, but you want to solve the real problem, which is preventing the team from checking in (and even knowing) what your secrets are.  Another problem that you noticed is that Application Insights and your users are logging sensitive information that needs to be sanitized.

In this session you will learn how to get notifications when users have checked in secrets using GitHub and third-party tools.  You'll also see how to leverage secrets in your code without having to know the secrets, both locally and at Azure via the Azure Key Vault.  

You will then learn how to leverage secrets that need to be shared to Azure App Configuration and have the ability to use them from your local and Azure environments.

To complete the journey, you will then learn how to capture output before committing to your logs (or app insights) with a few simple code changes to make sure that sensitive information is sanitized before being permanently recorded. </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

If so, I suggest checking out Capture The Flag competitions! These competitions, often called CTFs for short, are multi-challenge events where you solve puzzles to retrieve flags. To complete these puzzles, you may need to hack a website, crack an encrypted string, decompile code, or even just think critically about a series of picture clues provided to you. 

Does this sound interesting but you're still not quite sure know how to get started? I'm here to help with that! In this session, I'm going to walk you several common CTF challenges, step by step. These challenges include SQL Injection, Cryptography, Hardware Analysis, and Reverse Engineering. We'll then discuss some tips I have for when I get stuck, and wrap up with some resources for where you can go to practice these new skills on your own.  </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

The ability to deliver feedback is an essential skill for high performing teams. Good feedback is clear and delivered in a way that preserves working relationships. This talk will explore key elements to include in good feedback and leave attendees able to more confidently and effectively communicate both positive and constructive thoughts to their teammates.

We’ve all been in a situation where we want to give feedback but are struggling to find the best way to do it. Maybe a coworker said something in a meeting that undermined your credibility or a teammate is consistently delivering late or low quality work. How do you address the situation in a way that preserves your working relationship, but still solves the issue? Giving feedback can feel awkward. What do I say? Am I going to hurt their feelings?

We will explore methods for giving well crafted feedback that make sharing your observations with a teammate feel less daunting and lead to more productive team dynamics. </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

What if you don't know SQL? What if you don’t know the underlying data model? You just want to ask a question in plain English? Natural Language Processing (NLP) to SQL query converters can help you with that. They are tools that take your natural language question as input, and then use artificial intelligence methods to figure out what you mean and how to express it in SQL. Then they output the SQL query that matches your question, so you can run it on the database and get the answer you want.  Join Ross McNeely as he dives into successfully implementing NL2SQL with Databricks Genie, PBI Semantic Model Copilot, Fabric AI Skills, Snowflake Cortex Copilot, and Snowflake Cortex Analyst.  The focus will be on best practices regarding instructions, examples, and modeling. </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

Most of the time, when approached with this scenario, organizations resort to a very expensive rewrite project.  What happens though, if the legacy application just needs 10-20 bug fixes and it otherwise sufficient for the time being?  

Advances in reverse engineering over the last few years have made binary patching and modification much easier than in the past.  Even for bytecode-based languages, such as C# (CLR) and Java (JVM), new tools allow for analyzing and even modifying existing programs, without the source code, without even recompiling!

Now bugfixes are just an example of the approach, but there is no reason to stop there! Here's a scenario; your business relies on an ancient 3rd party WinForm app for critical business processes; using reverse engineering and binary patching, there is nothing prohibiting you from introducing a REST API on top of the old application, thereby increasing the shelf life of the "legacy" software. </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

For example, one must accept you suck as a programmer before you can be good at it.  If you think there is something Zen in that, he does too.  Concrete examples will be mixed with theoretical principles to inspire you to think of your daily routine in new ways.

In this session, we'll learn about "The Data Dojo: A Power BI Community of Practice," which was established at Des Moines University to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience among faculty and staff interested in analyzing the data generated by their teams and departments. 

We'll also talk about the Data Dojo's egalitarian founding principles and unconventional structure, some of the topics we've covered at our workshops, what has gone right, what we could have done better, and what we're planning for the future.

And finally, we'll discuss how you can encourage data literacy and foster a vibrant data culture within your organization by establishing a Data Dojo of your own! </p></div><!--ng-container--><!--bindings={

We will go over the boot process before the OS is executed and talk about some of the attacks that are possible at this stage and the impact such an attack can have on the entire platform. After this groundwork is complete, we will talk about how some of the different hardware root of trust technologies work to mitigate the risk posed by these types of attacks.
